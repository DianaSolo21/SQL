# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data into. 
# Below are the analytics I performed with the data. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#1 Who were the top ten most popular artists?
SELECT artist_name, 
AVG(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity LIMIT 10;

#2 What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC LIMIT 1;

#3 What is the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name, 
AVG(danceability)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity LIMIT 10;

#4 Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.

WITH avgpop AS (
SELECT artist_name,
AVG(popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
) 

SELECT artist_name, 
average_popularity,
'Top Star' AS tag 
FROM avgpop
WHERE average_popularity >=90;
